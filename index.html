            <h1>Social Equality And Rights</h1>
            <div class="underline"></div>

            <p>
                Equal rights, typically, an ideal of uniformity in treatment or standing by those in a setting to affect either. 
                Acknowledgment of the right to equality frequently has to be pushed from the advantaged by the disadvantaged. 
                Equality of chance was the starting creed of U.S. culture, yet equal rights among all peoples and in between the sexes 
                has verified much easier to legislate than to attain in practice.
            </p>

            <p>
                Social or spiritual inequality is deeply embedded in some societies therefore hard to get over. Government efforts to 
                attain economic equality include enhancing chances with tax obligation policy, subsidized training and education, and 
                redistributing wealth or sources, preferential treatment of those traditionally treated unequally.
